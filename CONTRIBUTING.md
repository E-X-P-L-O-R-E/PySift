# Contributing Guidelines for PySift

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **PySift**! As of now, I am the sole developer, and the project is in its early stages. I appreciate your enthusiasm and support as I work towards releasing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 

## How to Contribute

1. **Understand the Project**: 
   - Familiarize yourself with the goals and functionality of PySift by reading the documentation and exploring the existing codebase. 
   - Check out the [README.md](link-to-readme) for an overview of the project, its features, and how to set it up.

2. **Wait for MVP Release**: 
   - Currently, I am focused on finalizing the MVP of PySift. Until the MVP is released, I will not be actively accepting contributions. 
   - Keep an eye on the projectâ€™s updates to know when the MVP is ready.

3. **Share Your Ideas**:
   - If you have suggestions, feature requests, or ideas for improvement, please feel free to reach out via [issue tracker](https://github.com/E-X-P-L-O-R-E/PySift/issues) or via email at [tanvipm19@gmail.com](mailto:tanvipm19@gmail.com), once the MVP is released.
   - Your feedback is valuable and can help shape the future of PySift.

4. **Stay Updated**:
   - Follow the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/E-X-P-L-O-R-E/PySift) to stay informed about the latest developments, releases, and opportunities to contribute.
   - Consider subscribing to notifications for issues and pull requests to get involved once the project opens up for contributions.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CoC.md). Please be respectful and supportive of one another. The goal is to foster an inclusive and collaborative community.

## Future Contribution Process

Once the MVP is released, the contribution process will involve:

1. **Forking the Repository**: 
   - Create a personal fork of the PySift repository.

2. **Creating a Feature Branch**:
   - Make sure to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you work on. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-new-module` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).

3. **Submitting a Pull Request**:
   - When your feature is complete or your bug fix is ready, submit a pull request against the main repository.
   - Include a clear description of the changes, why they are necessary, and any relevant information for review.

4. **Review and Feedback**:
   - I will review your pull request and may provide feedback or request changes. Please be open to discussion and collaboration to ensure the best outcome for the project.
